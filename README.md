## Project name

SofApp

## Short description

Soccer Federation Application

## Description

SofApp is an application intended to manage online all of the activities that happening in any National Soccer Federation, especially in Africa. At the beginning phase it focuses on the game competition aspect, but in the future it will be extended to the federation administration aspect.

## Motivation

Soccer is one of the biggest industries of money in the world. However, Africa is struggling to make profit of it due to the lack of appropriate management tools. Many young Africans are truly talented, but unfortunately there is no adequate tracking system to unveal and show to the world these talents at the right moment: there is no database to store and publish individual statistics required to attract the interest of the biggest clubs&#39; managers so that they can recruit these young people at the right price.

Something is intriguing me, a few elite of athletes have proven that soccer can make a huge contribution to the development of Africa, hence soccer may contribute to the reduction of poverty by creating various opportunities. As example, it is reported that Samuel Etoo and Nwankwo Kanu, amongst many others, have built some infrastructures in their origin countries such as schools, hospitals and they are involved in various social initiatives by investing the money they earned from european clubs.

The management of young african athletes is a big challenge unlikely some national soccer federations have management tools that only allow access to a little information while some others don&#39;t have any tool at all. Actually it is very difficult do get and share information about clubs and players in Africa. Sometimes the consequences are very unfortunate, many transfers are failing, some national teams and clubs are disqualified due to players&#39; false identity etc… while such problems could be avoid if there is a good tracking system.

SofApp is a huge contribution to help Africa to manifest and unveal to the greattest soccer managers which will trigger reasonable and more valuable transfers, then more money will be earned by young Africans, the money which will be invested in various sector of development. So in addition to increase profit in term of money, SofApp helps to solve the problem of mismanagement and eases the sharing of information.
